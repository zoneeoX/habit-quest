for every habit completed:
 1.user gets 25+ exp
 2.for every 100 exp user will 1+ level

when exp will reach 100 in db will be resetted to 0 but level will still be 1
for example (code flow):
 1.exp is at 75
 2.reach 100 -> execute level += 1
 3.exp reset = 0, level is still 1
 4.reach 100 again -> execute level += 1 from level = 1, to level = 2
 5.exp reset = 0
 6.execute

q: then how do i get all the total exp?
a: we just level * 100

q: what if the level is at 75 but the level is at 1 for example
a: we just still do (level * max_exp) + current_exp, then we got for example (1 * 100) + 75 = 175

q: why is it like this?
a: at the time there was a problem where the exp bar would be like this, i would adjust the exp bar by the amount of exp
so if the exp is at 75 for example it would be 3/4 of the bar filled up with green (indicator),
so my solution was that, it was just to always reset the exp whenever the exp reaches 100
